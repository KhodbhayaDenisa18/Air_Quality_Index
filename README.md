# 🌍 Air Quality Monitoring Project

## 📌 Week 1 Progress (30%)
This is an internship project to build a **web application** that shows **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for different cities.  

In **Week 1**, the focus was on setting up the project and preparing **static city data**.

---

## ✅ Work Done in Week 1
1. Created the project structure:
air-quality-app/

├── index.html # Main webpage

├── style.css # Stylesheet

├── script.js # JavaScript logic

└── cities.json # 30–40 city details


2. Added **cities.json** file containing:
- City name  
- Country  
- AQI value  
- Main pollutant  

3. Connected `cities.json` with `script.js` using **fetch API** to display city details on the web page.

4. Verified that city details are properly displayed in the browser.

## 🖥️ How to Run (Week 1)
1. Download or clone the project folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
3. The app will display AQI details loaded from **cities.json**.

## 📅 Next Steps (Week 2 Plan)
- Integrate **OpenAQ API** for real-time AQI data.  
- Show AQI levels with **colored indicators** (Good, Moderate, Poor, Hazardous).  
- Add a **search/filter** option for cities.
